// Coding Steps:
//      For the final project you will be creating an automated version of the classic card 
//          game WAR! There are many versions of the game WAR. In this version there are 
//          only 2 players.
//      You do not need to do anything special when there is a tie in a round.
//      Think about how you would build this project and write your plan down. Consider 
//          classes such as: Card, Deck, Player, as well as what properties and methods 
//          they may include.
//      Four suits to represent the appearance (user interface - ui) for your cards
//          let cardSuits = ["Spades üó°Ô∏è", "Hearts ‚ù§Ô∏è", "Diamonds üíé", "Clubs üçÄ"];
//          console.log("Card Suits Example:", cardSuits);

// The game itself will automatically play using console.log() to display turns, 
//      points, cards used, and the outcome of the game. No user input via prompts 
//      is required.


// INSTRUCTIONS!!
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The completed project should, when executed, do the following:
// 
//      Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.
//      Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
//      The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point.
//      -Ties result in zero points for both Players.
//      After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.
